# AFK Marker
A small mod that shows an icon in the nametags of AFK players and next to their names in the tab list.

## Features
* Displays a crescent moon in the nametags of AFK players, as well as an icon in the tab list,
  with a customizable timeout before a player is considered AFK
* Players can use `/afk` to manually mark themselves as AFK
* Paused players will have a pause icon displayed instead of a moon until
  the AFK timeout is reached; this feature may be disabled in config.
